# Web_Design_Interface
Web Page made in college, sadly, lost the biggest part of it :(

- Download the files
- Extract the zip files
- All in the same repository, you should have Accueil.xhtml and the 2 folders
- Open Accueil.xhtml in your browser like google
- Enjoy the visit
- In the connexion page, just put some random things and complete the captcha to get a script page
- Sadly, the pages_libres isn't the final result but can't find the file
- I made it alone.
- Thanks.
